# Setup

Here is a simple recipe for you to get started:

## Install all the dependencies

```dos
npm i --verbose
```

## Setup  the ".env" file
```dos
MORGAN_ENV= development | production
PORT=       <any port you want>
NODE_ENV=   development | production
```

## Development

Now you are ready to have a minimal dev environment! Go back to the repository root directory and run:

```dos
npm run dev
```
